Going to school means to finding ways to pay for your own education. Whether through scholarships, loans, or work. 
To contribute to my future and sucess in my degrees of Information and Computer Science, and Theatre, I worked as a Sales Associate at our local Manoa Nijiya Market.
Working in a setting that is close to school and directly connected with public surrounding the school, has helped me learn not only more about the people but the importance of connecting with the community.
Some of the task given to me were working with a sales register, assisting the general public with any questions, and watching over the store to ensure a safe environment for all.

This has contributed to my education because I am more confident to communicate with others, and be able to work hard in group and team settings. Using all that I learned from this experience I can apply this
to working in teams and group settings with other students and future team members when working in a career in ICS. Communication is always going to be important in any setting, and I am happy that I was able to get
this experience during my college education.
