Being someone who is fairly new to programming, learning various computer languages have been both something to be excited about but also something very difficult to learn. I am excited to continue practicing and learning various languages such as C, Java, and Javascript. This semester, learning Javascript within the first two weeks, and continuing to learn more has opened my eyes to being more perceptive and trying to really understand the code that is being written. Therefore, comparing this to other languages, this language is much easier to learn, write, and understand. 

I think that Javascript is a good programming language to learn to be a starting point to help programmers and developers refine their programming and coding skills. In addition, it can be a tool to refer to and help think more critically about what is being asked to code. Iâ€™m not 100% sure how effective it would be in software development and engineering but based on my current experience, it can be used for basic programming and coding.

One thing that stands out to me about Javascript is its simplicity and easy to use for both beginners and intermediate users. The style in which you would be programming in is simple enough for anyone to be able to learn. With this, the Workout of the Day(WODs) has helped contribute to better understanding of the Javascript language. These practice WODs are useful in giving practice to students and even rookies like me. Additionally, through these practice exercises it is an efficient style of learning because it ensures that students will work on a problem as many times it takes, until they get it right. It can be stressful due to the time limit, but this time limit pushes the student, such as myself, to test whether we can critically think and solve a problem in a specific amount of time. It would work for me as long as I can review and continue to try and understand the code. Due to being a rookie, I am a bit more slower when typing code, which makes me stressed when working with a partner because I feel like I am pulling them behind, but overtime I hope to be able to become much more confident and better at programming.
