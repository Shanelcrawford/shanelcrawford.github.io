I am going to be completely honest, Computer Science and programming is not the easiest subject to grasp. When I first started this journey of learning computer science, I did not know fully how different it is to things that I am use to. For context, besides Computer Science, I study Theatre. Two completely differnet subjects, both which interest me. But when I took a certification class to my first programming class, I understood that this was a journey that I wanted to take.


In the beginning, I did not know anything about programming and coding. Being ina group with my fellow classmates, I understood that everyone was much more advanced, much more comfortable, and even more perceptive especially because they were use to Computer Science. But as time went on and I took more classes and studied long hours, finally, I felt like I was starting to feel more comfortable.


Before starting to feel more adept with Computer Science, I felt alone in not understanding what I am doing and even contemplated giving up. But my peers, professors, and even close friends supported me and encouraged me along the way to never give up. Perseverance is key. Not giving up and to keep working hard even if the problem is too hard or not being as good as the person next to me. With this I hope to eventually continue programming and be able to create my own app or game.
